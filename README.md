Quiz Application

The component Answer is used to display every single choice. The Quiz component is to show each question. 

After click the submit button, the Show and Result components will display information on the website. In the Show component, it will judge whether the user finishes all the questions or which question is correct/wrong and add color to the questions. The Result component is the responsibility to show the summary information on the head, like how many questions are correct and percentage. 

The Loading component will run before the data is ready. It has a loading-arrow gif file. 

In this task, I use the Context method to manage data. There is a file called 'Context.js', which is under the src folder. In this file, I defined some methods and states to help manage and record data.
